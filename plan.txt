## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| SMS provider downtime | Have backup SMS provider configured |
| Database failure | Implement daily automated backups |
| Server crashes | Use managed hosting with auto-restart |
| High traffic | Implement simple rate limiting |
| Security vulnerabilities | Regular dependency updates, input validation |

### Business Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Customers continue using old methods | Offer small discount for online orders initially |
| Staff resistance | Involve them early in testing, show time savings |
| Technical support burden | Create FAQ page, clear error messages |
| SMS costs too high | Set daily SMS limit, optimize message content |

## Weekly Check-In Questions

Use these every week to stay on track:
1. Did we complete planned tasks for this week?
2. Are there any blockers preventing progress?
3. Have requirements changed? Do we need to adjust scope?
4. Is the store owner still engaged and providing feedback?
5. Are we within budget for SMS testing and hosting?
6. Do we need to adjust timeline?

---

## Budget Considerations

### Development Costs
- Time investment: ~160-200 hours (10 weeks × 16-20 hrs/week)
- If paying developers: ₱50,000 - ₱150,000 depending on rates

### Operational Costs (Monthly)
- Hosting: ₱500 - ₱2,000 (Render, Railway, or similar)
- Database: ₱0 - ₱1,000 (free tier initially)
- SMS: ₱0.50 - ₱1.00 per message × estimated volume
  - If 100 orders/month × 5 messages = 500 SMS = ₱250 - ₱500
- Domain: ₱500 - ₱1,000/year
- **Total: ~₱1,500 - ₱4,000/month**

---

## Next Immediate Steps (This Week)

1. **Review and refine this plan** with your team
2. **Schedule meeting with store owner** to validate requirements
3. **Set up development environment** and project structure
4. **Correct all terminology** in your proposal (menu → products, cart → still cart is okay)
5. **Create detailed database schema** on paper/diagram tool
6. **Choose your tech stack** and justify choices
7. **Set up Git repository** and invite team members

## Notes & Reminders

- **Mobile-first is critical** - most Filipino users browse on phones with limited data
- **Keep SMS messages short** - costs add up, and users prefer brevity
- **Use Filipino context** - support barangay-level addressing, landmarks
- **Plan for slow internet** - optimize images, implement loading states
- **Cash on delivery is standard** - don't overcomplicate with online payments yet
- **Start simple, iterate** - better to launch with core features than delay for "perfect"

**Remember:** The goal is to solve the immediate problem (scattered orders, manual tracking) not to build a comprehensive e-commerce platform. Stay focused on scope!
